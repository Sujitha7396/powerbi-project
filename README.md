I recently explored a healthcare dataset using Power BI that focuses on stroke prediction. The dataset includes variables like age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, smoking status, and more.

**Key Insights I Visualized:**
Stroke risk increases significantly for individuals aged 60+.
Patients with both hypertension and heart disease show a higher likelihood of stroke.
Smoking status and BMI are also relevant risk factors.
Males and females had similar stroke rates, but age played a more dominant role than gender.
-This project helped me understand how Power BI can be used in healthcare analytics to identify patterns in patient data and support preventive care.

**Tools Used:**
Power BI (DAX, Power Query, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)
Dataset: Kaggleâ€™s Stroke Prediction Dataset
